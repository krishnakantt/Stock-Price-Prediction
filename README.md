# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning  
This project demonstrates how to predict future stock prices using various machine learning models and historical market data. By analyzing trends and patterns, the goal is to forecast the closing price of a given stock.  

## 🧠 Project Description  
This repository contains Python code to predict stock prices using supervised machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on historical stock data that includes daily Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume values, along with technical indicators like:

- Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Bollinger Bands  
Both traditional models (like Linear Regression and Random Forest) and time-series models (like LSTM) are used to compare results.

## 🗂️ Files in the Repository
- Stock.py: Core logic for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Stock Prices Data Set.csv: Historical stock data
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/krishnakantt/Stock-Price-Prediction.git  
cd Stock-Price-Prediction

2. Install dependencies  
pip install -r Requirements.txt  

3. Run the script  
Open Stock.py and run it in your preferred Python environment or use:  
python Stock.py

## 📊 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regression
- LSTM (optional, for time-series modeling)

## 📈 Output
- Actual vs Predicted Price Charts
- Model Performance Metrics (MAE, RMSE)
- Feature importance graphs (if applicable)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integration with real-time stock APIs
- Sentiment analysis using financial news or tweets
- Web app interface using Streamlit
